The goal of supervised learning with this dataset would be to predict whether an employee is likely to leave based on various features such as satisfaction level, number of projects, average monthly hours, etc.

Target Variable: The left column provides labeled data, making it suitable for training supervised learning models.

## Usage
This dataset is useful for predicting employee retention and understanding factors that contribute to employee turnover in an organization.
